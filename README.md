## General Information
- A simple Sudoku Game in Python using Pygame
- Passion project built to learn about Sudoku-solving algorithms
- Includes Backtracking Algorithm Visualization (in progress)

## Technologies Used
- Python - version 3.9
- Pygame - version 2.0.1


## Features
The SudoPy app comes with the following features:
- Working Sudoku Game with GUI
- Backtracking Algorithm Visualizer (in progress)


## Screenshots
<!-- ![Example screenshot](./img/screenshot.png) -->
<!-- If you have screenshots you'd like to share, include them here. -->


## Setup
The only library that you need to download for SudoPy to work is the latest version of PyGame, you can do that with the following command from the shell:
`pip install pygame`
After that, navigate to the main project folder and run the main.py script
`python3 main.py`


## Usage
In order to play the game, select the cell that you want to write a number into, and then press `RETURN` to commit the number to the cell.
In order to run the backtracking visualization, you can press `SPACEBAR` (not yet implemented)


## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_ 


## Room for Improvement
UI overhaul, including a Main Menu and instructions

To do:
- Backtracking Algorithm Visualization Feature
- Main Menu
- UI overhaul
- Sudoku Board generation
